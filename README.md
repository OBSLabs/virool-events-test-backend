#### INSTRUCTIONS

Here is a framework for a simple Rails App that, once finished, will surely impress your friends! Please fork this repo, run 'rake db:migrate db:seed', run the server using 'rails s', and modify it to do the following:

1. When you click on "expand" on the root page, it should make a call to the server and pull the necessary data from the database for that event using events/:event_id.json and events/:event_id/participants.json endpoints. 
2. Once this data has been returned, the event image should expand and display it like this (feel free to style it however you'd like): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4v3o5uwccpb8qfz/5729rtrb.png
3. When you click on the event name, you should be able to edit it inline, and when you click away, the name should be updated in the database using the PUT events/:event_id {"title": "foo", "description": "bar"} endpoint.

Feel free to come up with whatever solution you think is best, but this shouldn't take you more than an hour. When you're finished, please submit a pull request. Don't hesitate to email tom@virool.com if you have any questions! 

Good luck!
